For HackUMass XII, my friends and I had the amazingly brilliant idea to make a cheap 3D Scanner using stereovision. Except there wasn't any stereo, because we only had access to one Pi camera. 

So what ended up happening? We figured that since stereovision was essentially just taking two pictures simultaneously from different angles in order to obtain depth and distance, we could try to mimick that by taking a camera and moving it around different places around whatever object was being scanned. 

After some quick brainstorming, we wanted to move the camera along the x axis multiple times while the object would spin on a turn table. The hope was that each pair of images would produce a point cloud using an online Stereovision OpenCV repo. Was it a complex task to complete within 36 hours? Yes. But that was a problem for the software team, aka Karl. 

For the mechanical assembly, we immediately harvested a 3D Printer (thank you to UMass M5).
