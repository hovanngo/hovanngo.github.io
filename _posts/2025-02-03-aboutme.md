# Welcome.

My journey in the engineering world has been shaped by diverse experiences, from interning at Arc Industries, a renewable energy startup, to participating in FIRST Robotics competitions.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in personal engineering projects. Whether it's developing innovative solutions or experimenting with new technologies, I enjoy taking on the challenge of turning ideas into reality.

I am eager to continue exploring the field of robotics, particularly in areas that intersect with healthcare and human-robot interaction. My goal is to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact on society, leveraging my skills and experiences to drive innovation and create positive change.

This website is the place where I will post all of my projects, interests, and other things!
