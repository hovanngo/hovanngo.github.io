Two years ago I participated in my university’s hackathon with my friends Karl and Zach. We came in with a goal to have fun and make a cool project. We didn’t really know what we wanted to do, but eventually a conversation about the use of LiDAR led to the idea of a smart blind cane. Thirty grueling hours later, we finished what we called the LidaCane.

## Demo

Out of all of my projects, I would say that I enjoyed this one the most. There was a lot of software debugging, 3D print fails, and questionable solder jobs, but I was super proud of the cross-discipline collaboration and the quality of work that we made. Honestly, the event was so hectic that I was honestly shocked that we were even able to produce a finished produce.

I think this was apparent to the judges as well, as we ended up winning Best Healthcare hack and the Wolfram Award. If you want to read more about our project much more in depth, here's the link to the Devpost that we made:
