For my Cornerstone of Engineering class at Northeastern, my team and I were tasked with creating a museum exhibit aimed at sustainability. After a lot of discussion, we ended up with a "kelp farming" oriented game. And what better theme to base it off of than Minecraft?

For this project, I wrote the entirety of the GUI in Python Tkinter. I also wrote the Arduino code that controlled the different sensors and buttons.

Here is a link to the github repo:

I also helped author a 150 page technical report to go along with the project, but that would be a tad bit too long to put here.
