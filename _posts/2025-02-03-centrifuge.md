description: My Highschool Senior Capstone project.

In highschool, I watched a video about how Stanford engineers were combatting the HIV epidemic by designing an ultra low cost centrifuge using paper and string. I was inspired and decided that for my capstone project, I wanted to create a proof of concept device that was both scalable and affordable for third world populations.
